# LLM4SustainableProtein

Welcome to the Guo Lab's repository for LLM4SustainableProtein. Here, various scripts and data files may be found, which were used in [our preliminary research](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.20598), where we developed a RAG-based multi-agent AI system, for assisting in information retrieval tasks relevant to sustainable protein production.

This multi-agent AI system was developed as a proof-of-concept, generously funded and supported by the Bezos Earth Fund, through a
Phase I grant under the AI Grand Challenge for Climate and Nature.

This study built not just an LLM-based AI system, but also a user-interface to enable ease of use of the system by researchers, as well as additional safety-based capabilities for screening associated compounds against known toxicological datasets. This shall all be made available in this repository, for local deployment and use by research teams. The project may also be further expanded, with time.

For now, scripts and other files relevant to the fine-tuning phase of the study (which fine-tuned GPT models), are available in the `fine_tuning` folder.

If you use any of our work for your own research, then please cite [our publication here](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.20598).
